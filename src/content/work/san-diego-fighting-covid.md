## Overview

When the pandemic hit, everyone was scared and uncertain. It was easy to watch the news and feel helpless to all the goings-on. Then, at the height of the personal protective equipment shortage in hospitals, a call went out for individuals to 3D print, assemble and donate gear to local authorities. I sought out the folks looking to organize in San Diego and offered to design and develop a website with all of the needed information and resources for others local to San Diego to help out.

It's a simple project, with few bells and whistles, but one that I am proud to have been able to make.

The site was built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, inside of a custom Nunjucks and Gulp system to componentize the parts. The logo and site was designed in haste in Adobe Illustrator.

## Challenges

The most technical part of the project was figuring out a quick way to integrate dynamic content into the site. I opted for hooking up a public AirTable Base to the site via the AirTable API, so the less technical moderators could quickly post news and updates. Not really a scalable solution, but it didn't have to be. A handful of entries along with the average traffic the site garnered kept us well within the limits of the platform.
