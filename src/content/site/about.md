#### hello!

I'm a principal software engineer, focused specifically on web development and engineering leadership. Currently based in San Diego, I'm currently a Director of Web Development at Fingerpaint and formerly the Director of Web Development at Traina and Manager of Experience Design at Jack in the Box. I have an A.E. in Software Engineering from Oregon Tech and a B.S. in Web Design & Development from AiCASD.

Beyond development, I love design, art, leadership, teaching, making, learning and problem solving. When I get a free moment I love to create [generative art](https://art.andrewwalpole.com) as well as explore robust-first computation and artificial living-systems via my [MFM.rocks](https://mfm.rocks) project.
