##### Hello and welcome!

I'm a principal software engineer, focused specifically on web development and engineering leadership.

Based in San Diego, I'm currently the **VP of Web Engineering** at [Fingerpaint](https://www.fingerpaint.com) and formerly the **Director of Web Development** at [Traina](hjttps://wearetraina.com) and **Manager of Experience Design** at [Jack in the Box](https://jackinthebox.com).

I have an *A.E. in Software Engineering* from Oregon Tech and a *B.S. in Web Design & Development* from AiCASD.

Beyond development, I love design, art, leadership, teaching, making, learning and problem solving. When I get a free moment I love to create [generative art](https://art.andrewwalpole.com) as well as explore robust-first computation and artificial living-systems via my [MFM.rocks](https://mfm.rocks) project.
