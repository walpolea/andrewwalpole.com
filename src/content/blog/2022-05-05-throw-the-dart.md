# Throw the dart

You don’t get good at darts by holding on to a dart, analyzing it’s form, composition, weight, learning about its history, the dart production, packaging and distribution process, binge-watching hundreds and hundreds of dart-throwing videos on Youtube, showing the dart to friends and dart enthusiasts and philosophizing about how it works and how it will fly when it is thrown. Then, at the last possible second, when the game has started, when it counts, when it has to be good, *when it can’t fail*, you throw the dart.

All of that education and preparation you did may help a little, you might not miss the board. But I hope you agree with me and see that there is a much more efficient way to get better at darts; to compete when it counts.

### Throw the dart. Early. Often. Again, and again and again.
