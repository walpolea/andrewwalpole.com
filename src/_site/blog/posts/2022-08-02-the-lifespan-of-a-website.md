We often say we need to, "change our perspective." But having one perspective, even if it is constantly informed and evolved feels limiting still. Instead: *collect perspectives*. Being able to change the attitude at which you approach and view a problem or a person or an idea has profound implications on your ability to make and do things for others. Superficially, I think it's a no-brainer thought, but in practice there's a difference in feigning understanding of another perspective and actually embodying it. Perhaps this is what makes actors great actors.

I've spent a lot of time trying to hone this skill. Some perspectives come easier than others, and some present very hard barriers, like culture, that are required to understand at a level that is not available to me as an outsider. So it's not exactly something that I can present a 5-step plan to make you better at it. But trying at all seems like it might be good enough to promote as much of the world, or perhaps the loudest parts of the world seem to promote a more black and white perspective, valuing strong rigidity over flexible nuance.

I think the entry point then is to give up on hard lines; *everything is a continuum, on a spectrum*. The hard-lined labels we apply to groups may have utility in some circumstances, but not as a way to replace the spectrum altogether.

Viewing your perspective as a place on this spectrum allows you to attempt traversal across it. Instead of asking yourself to reverse your view for a moment, ask what more or less of something looks and feels like; ease along into the changing of how you might see something.
