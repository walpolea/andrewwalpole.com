I can't claim these words, but they've stuck with me from an old (2009 maybe?) Adobe MAX talk by [Erik Natzke](https://twitter.com/natzke), and so I thought I might pass them forward here.

I love learning new things. Being a part of the web industry right now, it's essential to constantly be learning new things if you want to keep up with the latest and greatest. But there's a cost to focusing on that idea too much. Worrying about figuring out how to keep up can be a huge emotional drain, and with all the avenues there are to explore it's quite easy to burn-out on the burden of learning.

> 'What you've done is what you'll do' manifests for me in my daily life in two main ways:

### Scoped Learning

First, it reminds me that when there is something new to learn, I can break it up into two major buckets: "Do I want to know *how to do* this?" or "Do I just want to know *about* this?"

The latter question carries a ton of utility while removing a lot of the burden that comes along with learning how to do something. If I can hear a business case from a client or even coming from my own ideas and think of a technology I may *know about* that fits the bill, that's all I need in that moment; the doing can come later if it needs to.

Most importantly, I find that explicitly setting this scope of learning for myself up-front provides a boost to my drive to dig-in, because the expectations are set; I know, generally, the size of the hill I'm about to climb and so I can prepare accordingly for the trek.

### Power in Doing

Don't get me wrong, the last paragraph was all about *NOT DOING* if you don't have to, but I think closer to Erik's point in his talk, this idea is also all about leaning in extra on what you know how to do already.

> When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, and that's ok!

You've put that extra learning time into what you do. You wield your craft. *Be proud of it*, and then find the places you can keep doing it. The whole generalist vs. specialist thing sort of rubs me the wrong way, because as a self-proclaimed web generalist, I find that I have a very specific set of skills: the things I actively *do*! And I think that's actually true of most folks.

If you ask me to build a site, I'll probably use Eleventy or Vue or just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, *I've done that*. If you want to start an online store, I might push you over to Etsy, *I've done that*. If you need some [generative art](https://art.andrewwalpole.com) I might make it with P5.js or Processing, *I've done that*. Need an API? I'll build you one with serverless functions, *I've done that*. Want a custom 3D printed trophy, I'll design it in illustrator and fusion 360, slice it with Cura and print it on my Ender 3 Max printer, because *I've done that*.

Part of it is that, yes, I put in the time and got experience in doing these things, but the other important piece is that getting to that point also means I must have had a good experience, I must have liked it, at least somewhat, to the point that I can continue to come back to these skills as the core of what I do.

Sure, I'll learn to do more things in the future and I can continue to build out this list. But do I have to? I don't think so, as long as those skills remain relevant, I find it incredibly useful to remind myself that **what I've done is what I'll do, and that's great**.
